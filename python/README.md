### This is the python version of the eduPIC code.
### Written by Hemaditya Malla
### Since I use dataclasses, PYTHON version 3.7.0 or above is needed
### Improvements:
- Anything that can speedup the code.
- I might've used some datastructures that are an overkill for the function they perform, so improve them. 
- Check if old sim data is being re-written and throw out a warning
- Removed the functionality to have to first perform a cycle and then restart the simulation
